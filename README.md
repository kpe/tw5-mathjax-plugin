# [tw5-mathjax-plugin](https://kpe.github.io/tw5-mathjax-plugin/)


TW5 plugin adding support for LaTeX through MathJax.

*N.B.* - there is an officially supported LaTeX plugin based on KaTeX hier - https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/tree/master/plugins/tiddlywiki/katex.

# Usage

Try something like this in a tiddler (or it's title):
```
Some inline math: $\sum_{i=1}^{100}i = 5050$, as:
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{100} = (1+100)\frac{100}{2}
$$
```
